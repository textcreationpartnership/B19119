            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

And whereas the said <hi>Earle,</hi> by the mischievous practice, and fraud in first procuring some pretended Authority from His Majesties late Admirall, that so he might seeme to have some Authority from, and under His Majesty, did thereby get the said Ships, and the men in them so farre into his possession, and power, that His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty wanted convenient meanes of conveying His Declaration to His said Subjects of that deceit, &amp; of the want of His Majesties consent, and of the absolute want of any just power, or authority which the said <hi>Earle,</hi> or any other without His Majesties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent could have of commanding of, or medling with His Majesties said Ships, by pretence of any Order, or Ordinance of one or both Houses of Parliament, wherewith he had misled His Majesties said Subjects.

And likewise that none of His Majesties Victuallers assist therein for the victualling of them, nor any of His Gunners, Boatswaines, Pursers, or Carpenters, goe to Sea in any of them; And that none of the Trinity. housemen, or others presume to take charge of any of His Majesties Ships, either as Captaines, Masters, Pylots, or Master-mates, And that no Mariners, Saylor, Waterman, or other take any entertainement, or pay, or give any assistance, or doe any service in carrying, or conducting any of His Majesties Ships to Sea, or on the Sea without His Majesties direction to be signifyed under His great Seale, or signe Manuall, Notwithstanding any Order, or Ordinance of one, or both Houses of Parliament. And His Majesty doth further Declare, That He will not faile to take all possible care to provide for the safety of the Kingdome by such a guard of His Ships as shall be necessary, when He shall have hereby prevented such wicked designes upon His Navy as might disable Him so to provide for the same, His Majestie nothing doubting, but that this Kingdome, that in the courage, loyalty, skill, and knowledge of such of this Nation as have commanded and served at Sea, hath found safety at home, and been renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and feared through all the world, will by the same helpes find the same benefit, if by the malice of wicked men they be not taken from Him, or imployed against Him.
